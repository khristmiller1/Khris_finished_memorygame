# Memory game
Khristopher Miller Udacity Memory Game Project

Click the cards to flip them over. When two card symbols match, the cards will stay visible.
If the cards do not match, both will flip back to the starting state of being hidden.

The rating system is displayed with stars, the lesser the amount of moves it takes you to match all the pairs,
the better rating you will have. 3 stars is best, 1 star is worse that can be rewarded.

# Have Fun!
